# Neural Network from Scratch

Neural network from scratch in Python. This repository contains several files. Commonly, fully connected and activation layer are combined. But, I separate them for easier differentiation.
1. `base.py`: base layer class.
2. `fc.py`: fully connected layer class. you can see [this image](./fc.png) to help you understand about the variables.
3. `activation.py`: activation layer class.
4. `nn.py`: the network class.
5. `loss.py`: defined loss function.
6. `main.py`: main file to run the neural network.
